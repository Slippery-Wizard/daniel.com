Is your name Daniel? Have you even been to
            <a href="http://daniel.com?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.github.developerdan.com%2Fdaniel.com%2F%0A">Daniel.com</a>?
            Well... it has been neglected. If you had the power to make Daniel.com better, what would you do?
            I would like to make it something that all Daniel's could be proud of - make it about something
            that we all have in common...<strong>Daniel</strong>!
            I'm no designer, but I threw together some ideas. The first one is what inspired all this to begin with:
            <a href="https://jesse.com/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.github.developerdan.com%2Fdaniel.com%2F%0A">Jesse.com</a>!
