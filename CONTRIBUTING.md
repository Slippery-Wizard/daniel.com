## How to contribute to Daniel.com

* No external links or resources (images, css, etc).
* Keep it simple. Browser support hacks should not be included.
* There really shouldn't be any need for 3rd party libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery.
* I won't go as far as saying no JavaScript allowed... but please avoid it.
* Each template should be fully self-contained. No cross-template resource sharing.
* No 'build' tools (looking at you Node and SCSS).
* Be nice and courteous, this is meant as a lighthearted project. At the end of the day, we're all just a bunch of Daniels.
